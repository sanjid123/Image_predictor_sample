# Image Predictor Sample

Welcome to the Image Predictor Sample repository! This repository contains a basic Python script (`image_predictor.py`) 
that demonstrates how to use a pre-trained deep learning model to predict the class of an uploaded image.

## Project Overview

This project showcases a simple application of deep learning and image processing. 
The script uses a pre-trained VGG16 model to classify images based on the ImageNet dataset's label mapping.

## Getting Started

To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Image_predictor_sample.git
   cd Image_predictor_sample
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow opencv-python
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python image_predictor.py

## Contributions:

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you find any issues, have suggestions for improvements, 
or want to extend the functionality, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Disclaimer
This repository is for educational purposes only and serves as a starting point for understanding basic image classification using a pre-trained model. 
For more complex tasks, additional considerations such as ethical implications, dataset quality, and model performance should be addressed.

"Also this code work better in Google colab notebook"
